\section{Background/Motivation}\label{sec:background}

Univerisity rankings play a key role in the academic environment from\\ several perspectives.
\begin{itemize}
	\item research opportunities
	\item strong candidates for undergraduate studies who seek to study at the
		best institutions
\end{itemize}
 As research quality is the key criterion for our reseacrh we have looked for
 relevant data sets which consider quality of education as primary factor when
 performing university ranking and rating systems.


We want to get an overview of the dynamics of two commonly used university rankings over the last 10 years.
Our research should identify the strong institutions that remained in the top and also point out the reasons why other ones made it a few places higher while others dropped in the ranking. Correlate the found out reasons with the variables on which we base our research.
