    23 Sept - 7 Oct & Consult with the team on their findings and together decide on the, most suitable tools for our research and apart from that, collect their results and start making a rough, analysis of the data. & Put the data in an appropriate format(vector, matrix) to use for analysis, identify and test tools to be used to generate graphs and numbers. & Investigate the 2 sources of data and extract relevant info from the data. \\ \hline
    8 Oct- 21 Oct   & Work on the statistical analysis  and interpret the findings based on both number and graphs/seek, possible in-depth correlations.                                                                   & Generate the respective visuals.                                                                                                              & Use the data to seek for correlation factors.                              \\ \hline
    22 Oct - 4 Nov  & Based on the previous stage and on Alex's results put together the two approaches used for statistical analysis and generate the results. Make sure we are on track with the project.               & Start gathering results from the rest and put the data in a unified format (visual and numerical) easy for analysis.                          & Classification                                                             \\ \hline
