Roxana        & Consult with the team on their findings and together decide on the, most suitable tools for our research and apart from that, collect their results and start making a rough, analysis of the data. & Work on the statistical analysis +and interpret the findings based on both number and graphs/seek, possible indepth correlations. & Based on the previous stage and on Alex's results put together the two approaches used for statistical analysis and generate the results. Make sure we are on track with the project. & \multirow{3}{*}{\begin{tabular}[c]{p{3cm}}All 3 of us interpret the results and put the results in graphs, plots.

Vlad          & Put the data in an appropriate format(vector, matrix) to use for analysis, identify and test tools to be used to generate graphs and numbers.                                                       & Generate the respective visuals.                                                                                                  & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}Start gathering results from the rest and put the data in a unified\\ format (visual and numerical) easy for analysis.\end{tabular}                        &                                                                                                                                                                                                                 &                                                            \\ \cline{1-4}
