\section{Research question/specific focus}
Our main research questions are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item What are the main criteria which make a university to be ranked as a top one?
	\item Which field of study is predominant at a top ranked university and which is the relation to the position?
	\item Which particular feature should a top university have if it is ranked as a top one?
	\item What are the chances that a non-top university make it into top 10-20 and what are the changes that have been done in that area?
	\item Finally trying to predict what changes are needed to be done by a university to make it into the top.
\end{itemize}

We will be focusing on the academic results when we analyze the rankings. Also we will not take into account the background of the students.
