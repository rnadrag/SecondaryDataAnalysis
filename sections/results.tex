\section{Expected results/Main hypotheses/Main claims}
\subsection{Expected results} 
\begin{itemize}
\item We will expect to see a correlation between the ratio (students enrolled in universities and \\total population) and the quality of studies that country offers. A higher ratio should imply better quality of studies.
\item We will expect to see a severe modification in the ranking when a country modifies it's tuition fees policy or passes new education laws.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Main hypotheses}
Even those countries that are not represented by a high number of universities in the top, can be competitive in the quality of studies they offer. 
\subsection{Main claims}
\begin{itemize}
\item USA is the leading country by producing specialists of any field.
\item UKs overall rankings will be affected by the changes of tuition fees in 2004 and 2010.
\item Germany, France and Switzerland are serious competitors in the university business when it comes to engineering. 
\end{itemize}
