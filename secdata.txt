Background:

- Univerisity rankings play a key role in the academic environment from several persp.
  - research opportunities
  - strong candidates for undergrad study who seek to study at the best institutions.
 As research quality is the key criterion for our reseacrh we have looked for relevant data sets which 
 consider quality of education as primary factor when performing university ranking and rating systems. 

Motivation: 
- get an overview of the dynamics of two commonly used university rankings over the last 10 years.
- identify strong institutions (which remain in the top), identify new univ which made it and the ones that did not.
- identify reasons for each of these and seek a correlation factor with the specific focuse on the univ 

Research question:

- what are the main criteria which make a univ be ranked as top?
- which particular field of study seems to be predominant as to what makes a uni good?
- which particular feature(location/major/) should a good uni have to make it to the top?
- what are the chances of some other unis to make it to the top or how strong is the dynamic in the top 10-20 (freq changes/no changes)?
- finally trying to predict what kind of changes should a uni make such that it goes up in ranking

specific focus
- looking at these rankings from a academic persp only
- not taking into account private/public/student background/ size of uni and so on
since the data we have chisen is primarly focused on quality of the education in the resp. institution

expected results
- graph analysis 
- correlation factor strong between X and Y because Z
- considering the univ rankings we use as main source of data, we expect to
  have a good classification wrt the variables(name them) we chose to focuse on as mentioned in the prev. section 
- ???

main hypotheses - do in class (see bottom ***)
- ???
- ???
- ???

limitations:
- our study focuses on specific subject areas 
- we look at the data from a scientific point a view so some future work can
- be done in finding correlation factors wrt to other variables(student background for ex.)
- overcome them - after we have defined the main topic and the relevan research q, we looked for data
- which takes into account mostly what we are looking for in order to maximize our chanes of find strong 
correlations which can be then explained and used for further analysis and predictions

Here are some examples of statistical hypotheses:

The mean age of all GSLIS students is 23.4 years.

The proportion of GSLIS students who are women is 76 percent.
The variable Hm, representing heights of GSLIS male students, is approximately Gaussianly (i.e.,
normally) distributed.

The modal grade in LIS 397.1 this semester will be B.
The proportion of books in the Podunk Public Library whose heights exceed 30 cm is less than or
equal to 0.13.

A related (and more technical) definition is: A statistical hypothesis that specifies a single value for a population
parameter is called a simple hypothesis; every statistical hypothesis that is not simple is called composite. Examples
a, b, and d above are simple; c and e are composite.

It is an interesting fact of language that in any situation involving a possible relationship, there are always at least
two ways of stating a hypothesis about the relationship: affirmation of the relationship, or denial of it. That is, we
can always choose between saying "A stands in relationship R to B" or "A fails to stand in relationship R to B." In
terms of typical statistical hypotheses, such a pair of examples might be: "The mean value of variable X equals the
mean value of variable Y," and "The means of variables X and Y are different." Note also that further variants are
possible, such as "The mean value of variable X is not different from the mean value of variable Y," and "The means
of variables X and Y are not equal." It is usually easier to understand hypotheses that are stated positively than
those that are stated negatively.

Statistical hypotheses are statements about real relationships; and like all hypotheses, statistical hypotheses may
match the reality, or they may fail to do so. Statistical hypotheses have the special characteristic that one ordinarily
attempts to test them (i.e., to reach a decision about whether or not one believes the statement is correct, in the sense
of corresponding to the reality) by observing facts relevant to the hypothesis in a sample. This procedure, of course,
introduces the difficulty that the sample may or may not represent well the population from which it was drawn.
